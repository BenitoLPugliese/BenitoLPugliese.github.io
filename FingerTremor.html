                <h2>Wearable Finger Tremor Monitor for Parkinson’s Disease</h2>

                <p>
                    Tremor is one of the most recognizable motor symptoms of
                    <strong>Parkinson’s disease (PD)</strong> and can significantly affect fine-motor
                    function and quality of life. Clinically, tremor severity is usually assessed
                    through brief in-clinic exams and ordinal rating scales, which provide only a
                    coarse snapshot of a highly dynamic symptom.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project explores a <strong>wearable system to quantify finger tremor</strong>
                    using lightweight accelerometers mounted on the fingertips and a modified
                    Shimmer3 sensing platform. The goal was to obtain high-resolution,
                    quantitative tremor metrics during a protocol designed to test the effectiveness
                    of a <strong>mechanical vibration–based intervention</strong> for tremor reduction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was responsible for the <strong>hardware modification, firmware development,
                        data acquisition pipeline, and data analysis</strong>, adapting an existing research device
                    to a new multi-sensor configuration suitable for clinical studies.

                                The system is built around a <span class="highlight-role">Shimmer3</span> unit,
                                which was extended using the <span class="highlight-role">Proto3 expansion board</span>
                                to access unused microcontroller pins and interface with additional sensors.
                                Three small wired accelerometers were mounted on the index, middle, and ring
                                fingertips to capture finger tremor independently.

                            <p>
                                On the firmware side, I <strong>modified the Shimmer3 firmware</strong> to:

                                        channels</strong>,</li>
                                <li>Store the combined data locally for offline analysis.</li>
