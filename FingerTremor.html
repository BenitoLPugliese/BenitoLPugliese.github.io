                    <span class="highlight-role">Purpose: </span>
                    Tremor is one of the most recognizable motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD)
                    and is typically assessed through brief clinical exams and ordinal rating scales,
                    which provide only coarse snapshots of a highly dynamic symptom. This project explored
                    a wearable system to obtain high-resolution, quantitative finger tremor metrics during
                    intervention studies.
                </p>

                    <span class="highlight-role">System Overview: </span>
                    A lightweight multi-sensor wearable was developed by extending a Shimmer3 research platform
                    to support additional fingertip-mounted accelerometers, enabling independent tremor capture
                    from multiple fingers during controlled clinical protocols.

                    The system enabled high-resolution tremor metrics beyond standard clinical scales and was successfully deployed
                     in a clinical study setting.
