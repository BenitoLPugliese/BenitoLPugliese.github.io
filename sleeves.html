                    <h2>Sensorized Sleeves for Adaptive Knee OA Rehabilitation</h2>

                    <p>
                        Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is among the leading causes of disability worldwide.
                        It is characterized by joint pain, stiffness, and inflammation, which progressively
                        limit mobility and reduce quality of life. While there is currently no cure,
                        <strong>physical activity and exercise</strong> are the cornerstone of conservative management,
                        helping slow disease progression and maintain function.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, the relationship between exercise and symptoms is delicate:
                        insufficient activity limits benefits, whereas over-exercise can worsen pain, swelling,
                        and inflammation. Today, the “optimal” dose of physical activity is usually found
                        through <strong>trial and error</strong>, guided by patient-reported symptoms and clinical
                        judgment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My work explores <strong>sensorized knee sleeves</strong> that monitor knee biomechanics
                        and physiology during exercise. By capturing changes in flexion–extension kinematics,
                        thermal patterns related to inflammation, and bioimpedance signatures of tissue
                        composition, these systems aim to enable
                        <strong>data-driven, adaptive rehabilitation programs</strong> that proactively adjust
                        exercise dosage before symptoms flare.

                                    The second sleeve focuses on <strong>skin temperature distribution</strong> over the

                                    as a proxy for inflammation. A wearable prototype integrating an array of
                                    thermistors has been designed to monitor
                                    the knee surface temperature pattern during and after exercise.

                                    Thermal camera recordings are used as a reference to estimate the

                                    over the joint. The wearable array is designed to reproduce HDI estimates in real

                                    enabling continuous monitoring of how exercise bouts modulate local inflammation.
