                <h2>Overnight Bedroom CO₂ Monitoring</h2>

                <p>
                    This project started from a simple question:
                    <strong>how good is the air quality in my bedroom overnight</strong> when I sleep
                    with the window closed and no active ventilation?
                    Rather than guessing, I built a small data logger to measure it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I used a <strong>Sensirion SCD30</strong> CO₂ sensor and an <strong>ESP32</strong> board,
                    programmed to periodically sample CO₂ concentration, temperature, and humidity and
                    store the data locally on a <strong>microSD card</strong>. The whole prototype runs on
                    a breadboard and can be powered from USB, making it easy to place on a nightstand.
                </p>

                                The plot below shows data from one full night. At time <strong>0 hours</strong>
                                the window was open and the measured CO₂ level was around
                                <strong>600 ppm</strong>, which is typical outdoor air for Boston.
                                I then closed the window and went to sleep.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After about <strong>1 hour</strong>, the CO₂ concentration passed
                                <strong>1000 ppm</strong>, a commonly used threshold indicating that indoor
                                air quality is starting to degrade. Overnight, CO₂ kept rising and reached
                                approximately <strong>1400 ppm</strong>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Around <strong>9 hours</strong>, I opened the window again.
                                As fresh air entered the room, the CO₂ level dropped rapidly back toward
                                baseline, clearly visible in the plot. 
                            </p>

                                Left: ESP32 + SCD30 CO₂ sensor and microSD card adapter on a breadboard,
                                used to log CO₂, temperature, and humidity overnight. Right: Overnight CO₂, temperature, and humidity in the bedroom.
                                CO₂ rises from ~600 ppm to ~1400 ppm with the window closed,
                                then drops quickly when the window is opened again around 9 hours.
